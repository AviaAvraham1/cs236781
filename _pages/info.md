Deep learning is widely used in a growing range of applications ranging from
image classification and generation, text comprehension, signal processing, game
playing and more. This course will focus on algorithms, programming frameworks
and new hardware and software interfaces that aim to allow execution of deep
learning algorithms in an efficient way. It will provide both the necessary
theoretical background and the hands-on experience required to be an effective
deep learning practitioner, or to start on the path towards deep learning
research.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, the student will:

1.	Understand and be able to apply notions in deep learning.
1.	Know how to effectively use leading python machine-learning and deep
    learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
1.	Know how to optimize software and hardware performance in deep neural
    network applications.
1.	Know how to leverage GPUs and write custom computational kernels to
    accelerate both training and inference.
1.	Perform a small research project using the studied notions and techniques.

## Detailed Syllabus

This semester, the course will be presented using a flipped-classroom approach.

Students are expected to watch and read the pre-requisite material, available
from the couse [Lectures page]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures) before each class.
The in-class lectures will then be divided into a *supplementary* part, relating
to the pre-requisite material and an *introductory* part presenting new material
relating to the next lecture.
