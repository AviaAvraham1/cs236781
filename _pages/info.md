Deep learning is widely used in many market segments ranging from mobile devices
to supercomputers. Recently many software packages as well as special hardware
accelerators were developed to support deep learning. The course will focus on
algorithms, programming frameworks and new software/hardware interfaces that aim
to allow execution of deep learning algorithms in a productive and efficient
way. 
 
## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, the student will:

1.	Understand and be able to apply notions in deep learning.
1.	Know how to effectively use leading python machine-learning and deep
    learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
1.	Know how to optimize software and hardware performance in deep neural
    network applications.
1.	Know how to program GPUs using CUDA.
1.	Perform a small research project using the studied notions and techniques.
