Dear Students,

Please note Tamir's tutorials due to be held on Thu 18.7.24, Thu 25.7.24 will not be held.

For the first tutorial of the two (sequence models) our group will have a make-up tutorial this Wednesday (17.7.24), at Ullman 308, 12:30-13:30.
I will make an effort to record it, however recording conditions in Ullman are not ideal, so I advise coming if you can.

The second tutorial we miss (attention) will not have an in-person make-up class. Instead, please complete this material from relevant recordings 
(will be uploaded in upcoming weeks). If you feel recordings were not enough for you, you are encouraged to ask on Piazza or email me directly to schedule a reception hour.

Of course, you can also join Moshe's group instead of making up material for these two tutorials if you prefer.

I apologize for the frequent schedule changes, the shifting of this "spring" semester into the summer causes some schedule clashes I couldn't otherwise resolve.
Please email me directly for any issues making up needed material and we will find further solutions as needed.

Have a nice week,
Tamir
