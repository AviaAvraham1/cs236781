## Instructions

Please read the instruction on each project thoroughly and follow them.
Each pair must choose exactly one project - you cannot mix them.
Make sure you submit both wet report and dry part answers as instructed.
You may ask clarifying questions on Piazza - if you do, please state which project you are asking about (INRs, VAEs or Contrastive Learning).
Please do not post any dry part answers, implementation ideas or details publicly on Piazza. You can use private posts if implementation details discussion is necessary.

Good Luck!
