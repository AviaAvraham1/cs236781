excerpt: Makeup tutorial and lecture room change
---

Dear Students,

Please notice the following two updates:

1. Tamir's tutorial group will have a make-up tutorial on Tuesday, 2.4, on 12:30 at Taub 7 (right before our regular tutorial).
This means we will hold a 2-hour tutorial instead of 1.

2. Chaim's lecture this week lecture (held on Thursday 28.3) will be held in Ulmann 201, instead of the regular room.

Best,<br>
Tamir.
