## Downloading

The assignment code is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/hw/w19-20/hw2.zip).

Note that there may be some updates in the `environment.yml` file since the
previous assignment. From within the assignment directory, run `conda env
update` to update your conda environment (only new dependencies will be
installed).

Make sure you activate the conda env for the homeworks (`cs236781-hw`), not the
env for the tutorials (`cs236781`).
