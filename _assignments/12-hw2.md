## Downloading

The assignment code is available
[here](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw2).

We recommend you use `git` to clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw2.git
```
This will allow you to pull updates from us in the event that they are needed.
