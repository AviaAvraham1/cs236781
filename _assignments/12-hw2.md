## Updates

### Update 1

- Changed the method for comparing actual vs expected outputs for CNNs and
  ResNets in part 2. This should provide more rubustness to numerical
  differences across machines.
- Updated the `jupyter-lab.sh` script.

No code changes should be required on your part.
To use this update, make sure to replace everything except for your code files
(`hw2/hw2/*.py`). You can unzip it to a new folder and copy only the code files with
your solutions from the previous version to the new version's folder.
