As part of this course, students must complete a small research project instead
of a final exam.

For this project you will either implement a current deep-learning
research paper or implement a custom project that relates to your current
research topic (subject to approval).

We provide you with a pool of project ideas mostly from recent papers.  The idea
is to select a paper that seems interesting you you, implement it, suggest at
least one improvement and evaluate it as well. Some papers may be more advanced
than others. Selecting a less advanced paper means we will expect you to also
implement more of your own extensions and ideas to improve upon it.

During the project period you will be able to meet with course TAs for guidance
during dedicated office hours.  The project can be performed in groups of at
most two students.

## Project procedure

1. Each group should read the topics and paper abstracts in the project topics spreadsheet.
1. Each group must fill out the registration form with their top-3 priorities
   or custom project proposal until date **13/01/2019**.
1. Soon after you submit your priorities, we will approve one of
   them. Submitting the form sooner will increase your chance of getting your
   first priority.
1. The final lecture of the course on **20/01/2019** will be dedicated to the
   projects. Each group will present a 5-minute (max) presentation about their
   topic. Feedback will be given by Prof. Alex Bronstein.
1. You will work on your projects. Weekly (optional) guidance meetings with
   course TAs at dedicated office hours will be available for you.
1. The **final** submission date for the project is **14/03/2019**. No further
   postponement will be possible; it is advised that you finish well before this
   date.
1. Your submission should be a detailed report. It should explain the problem
   and the paper you implemented (if relevant), explain your specific
   enhancements and modifications, showcase all your results (both reproduction
   of the paper and novel results, if any), include proper citations, etc.

## Registration links

Please view the [project
topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WtlyOQC5oVkR0EoxdBmKyaSk5xRJn_0UvAJH74SBhSw) (**updated with groups**)
and then fill out [this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeG0qfWuZwom6qtr-bg7F5SBl7JMxSlc0b21rZNAv-jmUJfsw/viewform) with your priorities.

## Guidelines for presentations

1. After you receive an email approving one of your project priorities,
   you should start working on your presentation.
1. Presentations slides should be emailed to
   [Aviv](mailto:avivr@cs.technion.ac.il) no later than **19/01/2019**.
1. We will publish the order of presentations in advance. Everyone will
   present from the same computer to reduce overhead between presenters.
1. The presentation should address briefly the following points:
    - Full project title and description
    - Previous related work or main paper
    - Proposed method or improvement
    - Baseline youâ€™re comparing to
    - Evaluation methods
1. Please keep your presentation short! Just 5-6 slides are enough, up to 5
   minutes total time.

## Project-related office hours

Will be announced soon.
