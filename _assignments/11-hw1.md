## Downloading

The assignment code is available
[here](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw1).

We recommend you use `git` to clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw1.git
```
This will allow you to pull updates from us in the event that they are needed.

## Updates

Updated the `environment.yml` so that it specifies a specific version of the
`torchvision` package. Some students got a newer version which caused issues in
part 3.

After pulling the update, run `conda env update` from within the `hw1` directory
to update your conda environment to use the correct version.
