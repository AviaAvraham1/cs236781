## Technical Notes

This assignment requires a different `conda` environment, which should be
installed prior to starting. Before installing the new environment, it is
recommended to run
```shell
conda update conda
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

And then install and activate the new environment as usual,
```shell
conda env update -f environment.yml
conda activate cs236781-hw4
```

**Q**: What is the `_final` checkpoint file?  
**A**: You must use this to create your final submission with result video from
your best-trained model. When you get results that your happy with, rename the
checkpoint file by appending `_final`. You don't need to submit the
`checkpoints/` folder (the `main.py` script will ignore them).

**Q**: Should the `results/` directory be part of the submission?  
**A**: Yes. The submission script will include it for you. This is OK. Do not
put any unnecessary files in this directory apart from the results files
generated by the notebooks.
