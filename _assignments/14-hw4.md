## Technical Notes for Part 1

- Part 1 does not require a GPU. We won't need large models, and the computation
  bottleneck will be the generation of episodes to train on.
- In order to run this notebook on the server, you must prepend the `xvfb-run`
  command to create a virtual screen. For example,
    - to run the jupyter lab script with `srun` do
        ```
        srun -c2 --gres=gpu:1 xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1440x900x24" ./jupyter-lab.sh
        ```
    - To run the submission script, do e.g.
        ```
        srun -c2 xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1440x900x24" python main.py prepare-submission ...
        ```
    and so on.
- The OpenAI `gym` library is not officially supported on windows. However it
  should be possible to install and run the necessary environment for this
  exercise. However, we cannot provide you with technical support for this. If you
  have trouble installing locally, we suggest running on the course server.

before starting the assignment.

**Q**: What is the `_final` checkpoint file?  
**A**: You must use this to create your final submission with result video from
your best-trained model. When you get
results that your happy with, rename the checkpoint file by appending `_final`.
You don't need to submit the `checkpoints/` folder (the `main.py` script will ignore
them).


**Q**: Should the `results/` direcory be part of the submission?  
**A**: Yes. The submission script will include it for you. This is OK. Do not
put any unnecessary files in this directory apart from the results files
generated by the notebooks.
