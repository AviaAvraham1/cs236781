**Submission date**: January 28th, 2020

## Topics

- Deep reinforcement learning based on policy gradients.


## Downloading

The assignment code is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/hw/w19-20/hw4.zip).

## Technical Notes

- This part does not require a GPU. We won't need large models, and the computation bottleneck will be the generation of episodes to train on.
- In order to run this notebook on the server, you must prepend the `xvfb-run` command to create a virtual screen. For example,
    - to run the jupyter lab script with `srun` do
        ```
        srun -c4 --gres=gpu:1 xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1440x900x24" ./jupyter-lab.sh
        ```
    - To run the submission script, do
        ```
        xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1440x900x24" python main.py prepare-submission ...
        ```
    and so on.
- The OpenAI `gym` library is not officially supported on windows. However it should be possible to install and run the necessary environment for this exercise. However, we cannot provide you with technical support for this. If you have trouble installing locally, we suggest running on the course server.


## FAQ

Make sure to read the [getting started page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _assignments/00-getting-started.md %})
and the [guide for using course servers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _assignments/01-hpc-servers.md %}).

**Q**: What is the `checkpoint_file_final` for?  
**A**: You can use this to create your final submission with result images from
your best-trained model. Just train with checkpoints enabled, and when you get
results that your happy with rename the checkpoint file with `_final`.
You don't need to submit the checkpoint files (the `main.py` script will ignore
them).


**Q**: Should the `results/` direcory be part of the submission?  
**A**: Yes. The submission script will include it for you. This is OK. Do not
put any unnecessary files in this directory apart from the results files
generated by the notebooks.
