**Q**: What is the `checkpoint_file_final` for?  
**A**: You can use this to create your final submission with result images from
your best-trained model. Just train with checkpoints enabled, and when you get
results that your happy with rename the checkpoint file with `_final`.
You don't need to submit the checkpoint files (the `main.py` script will ignore
them).


**Q**: How can we run long training blocks in the notebooks without running
them interactively in jupyter-lab (e.g. from command line on the server)?  
**A**:
The easiest way is to simply copy the block (and relevant `import` statements) into a new
python script and run that (with `srun`/`sbatch` on the server).
Another way is to convert the whole notebook to a python script, for example:
```shell
jupyter nbconvert Part1_Sequence.ipynb --to python
```
And then run it with `ipython` within `srun` or `sbatch`, for example:
```shell
srun -c 2 --gres=gpu:1 ipython Part1_Sequence.py
```
