## Downloading

The assignment code is available
[here](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw3).

We recommend you use `git` to clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw3.git
```
This will allow you to pull updates from us in the event that they are needed.

Note that there may be some updates in the `environment.yml` file since the

**Q**: What is the `checkpoint_file_final` for?  
**A**: You can use this to create your final submission with result images from
your best-trained model. Just train with checkpoints enabled, and when you get
results that your happy with rename the checkpoint file with `_final`.
You don't need to submit the checkpoint files (the `main.py` script will ignore
them).
