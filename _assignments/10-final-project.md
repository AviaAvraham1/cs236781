As part of this course, students must complete a small research project instead
of a final exam.

For this project you will either implement a current deep-learning
research paper or implement a custom project that relates to your current
research topic (subject to approval).

We will provide you with a pool of project ideas mostly from recent papers.  The
idea is to select a paper that seems interesting you you, implement it, suggest
at least one improvement and evaluate it as well. Some papers may be more
advanced than others. Selecting a less advanced paper means we will expect you
to also implement more of your own extensions and ideas to improve upon it.

During the project period you will be able to meet with course TAs for guidance
during dedicated office hours.  The project can be performed in groups of at
most two students.

The project pool and detailed project guidelines will be published on this page
throughout the semester.
