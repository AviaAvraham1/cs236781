As part of this course, students must complete a small research project instead
of a final exam.

For this project you will either implement a current deep-learning
research paper or implement a custom project that relates to your own
research topic.

We provide you with a pool of project ideas mostly from recent papers. The idea
is to select a paper that seems interesting you you, implement it, suggest at
least one improvement and evaluate it as well. Some papers may be more advanced
than others. Selecting a less advanced paper means we may expect you to also
implement more of your own extensions and ideas to improve upon it.  Also, some
projects on the list are custom projects offered by the VISTA lab. 

During the project period you will be able to meet with course TAs for guidance
during dedicated office hours.  The project can be performed in groups of at
most two students.

For questions regarding the project, please contact [Chaim
Baskin](mailto:chaimbaskin@cs.technion.ac.il).

## Project procedure

1. Each group should read the topics and paper abstracts in the project topics spreadsheet.
1. Each group must fill out the registration form with their top-3 priorities
   or custom project proposal until date **27/06/2019**.
1. Soon after you submit your priorities, we will approve one of
   them. Submitting the form sooner will increase your chance of getting your
   first priority.
1. You will start working on your projects.
   If necessary, you can schedule periodic meetings with course staff at dedicated
   office hours which will be published.
1. Your submission should be a detailed report. It should explain the problem
   and the paper you implemented (if relevant), explain your specific
   enhancements and modifications, showcase all your results (both reproduction
   of the paper and novel results, if any), compare your solution to the
   baseline method (if relevant), etc.
1. The submission date for the project is **01/10/2019**.
