Dear students,

You're invited to an ML seminar which may be of interest.

> Title: The World’s Deep Learning Runs on CPUs
> 
> Abstract: The conventional wisdom is that deep learning (DL) has to be done on
> accelerators.  However, the world’s deep learning runs very well on general
> purpose CPUs today, adaptable to deep learning that continues to evolve quickly
> from its early success in CNNs, to the adoption of RNNs, Recommendation Systems,
> and Reinforcement Learning with a wide range of performance characteristics for
> computer systems in production environments. In this talk, I will cover the
> hardware and software technologies that power AI in the world’s clouds and data
> centers. I will show a 200X performance improvement, and how to reduce inference
> to milliseconds and scale training to 1000s of compute nodes.
> 
> Bio: Wei Li is Vice President and General Manager of Machine Learning and
> Translation at Intel Corporation. In his 20 years at Intel, he has led
> innovative software efforts for artificial intelligence, clouds/data centers,
> mobile devices, and hardware/software co-design. He served as an associate
> editor for ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, and was on the
> joint Intel/Microsoft technical committee that funded the creation of parallel
> computing research centers at the University of California-Berkeley and the
> University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received a Ph.D. in Computer
> Science from Cornell University and completed an executive program at Stanford
> Graduate School of Business.

Time and location: Thursday, Jan 10th, Mayer 1003.
