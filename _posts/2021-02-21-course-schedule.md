Dear Students,

Starting from Thursday, March 25th, the course weekly schedule is as follows:

1. Thursdays, 10:30-11:30.  
   Supplementary lecture, presented by Chaim Baskin or Prof. Alex Bronstein.

1. Thursdays at 11:30-12:30.  
   Tutorial, presented by Aviv Rosenberg.

1. Wednesdays at 11:30-12:30.  
   Tutorial, presented by Evgenii Zheltonozhskii.

Notes:
- Evgenii's tutorial group starts from the **second** week of the semester
  (April 1st), so it comes after each week's lecture.
- The in-class lectures are supplementary and optional; the main lecture
  material is covered by Alex's videos. Weekly video-viewing schedule is
  defined in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md %}#detailed-syllabus).
  Make sure to watch the relevant video lecture each week **before** class.
- The Zoom links will be published to the course mailing list.
- All course meetings will be held in **English**.
- Everything will be recorded to provide you with maximal flexibility regarding attendance.

We wish you a productive semester and hope you enjoy the course!


Good luck,  
Aviv & course staff.
