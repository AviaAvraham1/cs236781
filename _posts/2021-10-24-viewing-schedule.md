excerpt: Required viewing material per week
---

Dear Students,

The **mandatory** viewing material for each week of this semester is detailed
in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md
%}#detailed-syllabus).

In each of the lecture links, only the main video is mandatory. The in-class
lectures provide supplemental material. They will be 1-hour long and aim to
present more advanced topics and new research in the field.

Thanks,  
Course staff.
