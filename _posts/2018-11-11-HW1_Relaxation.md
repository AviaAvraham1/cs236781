Hi all,

The hw1 repo was updated with a
[small change](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw1/commit/8ebc90f09e3f2a51e158bac51885476d2f92ec5f)
to relax the requirements in the gradient and loss calculation of Part 3.
This is to accommodate more varied implementations and help account for
numerical instabilities.

Please pull the updates.

Thanks,  
Course staff
