Dear students,

This Monday, April 27th, is a Thursday-schedule day in the Technion.
We will therefore have a class. Chaim will talk about advanced
training techniques over the scheduled Zoom meeting at 11:30.
Note that you do not need to watch video materials before this meeting.
There will be no tutorial Q&A at 10:30.

On Thursday, April 30th, there will be no class and on May 7th we'll resume with
the usual schedule.
The syllabus on the course [info
page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md %}) has been updated.

Thanks,  
Course staff.
