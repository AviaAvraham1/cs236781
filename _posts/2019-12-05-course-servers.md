Dear students,

The course servers are now working again.
Students who registered using the form should have access.

Please note that I've updated the instruction page. All the content relating to
job queues and the `-p` option is not relevant. Please don't use `-p` when
running slurm jobs with either `srun` or `sbatch`.  You should go over the
updated examples.

Enjoy,<br>
Course staff
