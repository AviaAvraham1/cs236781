Dear students,

The course servers are now working again.
Students who registered using the form should have access.

I've updated the instruction page. All the content relating to
course-specific job queues and the `-p` option is not relevant. Please don't use
`-p 236781` when running slurm jobs with either `srun` or `sbatch`.
You should go over the updated examples.

Also, please note that we cannot provide you with technical support regarding
the Technion VPN service. If you need help with using it please contact
[CIS](https://cis.technion.ac.il/en/).

Good luck,<br>
Course staff
