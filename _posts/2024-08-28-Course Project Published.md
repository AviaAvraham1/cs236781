Dear Students,

Please note the course final project has been published (refer to the assignments section for access).

This semester we allow choice of 3 proposed projects - you must choose exactly one project out of the 3 for your final project.
You do not need to run your choice by us, however please note that we will not accept any mixing between projects - each pair must choose one project, follow its
instructions completely (both dry and wet part) and submit needed reports until the deadline.

For questions please use Piazza as usual - we request that for each question relating to a specific project, indicate in the post header which project your post concerns, so
the relevant TA can respond.

We ask you do not post any implementation details or ideas on Piazza, as well any solutions to dry questions.

For extension requests - please use the designated [form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nNG6pzGaoeftJU_I1mYUbIYaZjuo7NTQYiK3HnwNbWk/edit?usp=sharing).

While the deadline is far, we strongly advise you do not postpone your work to the last minute - these projects could take some time to complete.

Good Luck!
Course Staff
