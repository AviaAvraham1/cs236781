Hi all,

The hw1 repo was updated with the following:

1. In part 4, a [correction](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw1/commit/d9fdbd845f2f458f72dd01b38284be43e0455f2e)
   was made to the expected MSE values when fitting the model to single features.
2. Added two [helper scripts](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236605-hw1/commit/9b49b54b8f9222db8d3f73aab67ed77e12063a41)
   for use on the course servers. These are the scripts that are mentioned in
   the  updated server usage instructions.

Please pull the updates.

Thanks,  
Course staff
