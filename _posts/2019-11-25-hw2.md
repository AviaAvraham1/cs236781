Dear students,

The second homework assignment has been published.

Please note that unfortunately the Faculty servers for the course are still not
available due to technical issues that arose.  According to the IT team the
issues should be resolved within the next few days.

However, only the Experiment sections in the end of Part 3 require the servers,
so you should start working on the assignment and we will update you as soon as
the servers are available.

Good luck,<br>
Course staff
