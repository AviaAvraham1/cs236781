Dear Students,

Due to your requests, starting this week we'll open an additional Tutorial

Nemcovsky**. 

The new group will be in addition to the tutorials given by **Aviv Rosenberg**
(Thursday, 12:30) and **Evgenii Zheltonozhskii** (Monday, 11:30).

Since all tutorials are given via Zoom, please feel free to attend any of the groups.
The Zoom links will be sent via email (and also appear on WebCourse, under
Announcements).


Thanks,  
Course Staff
