Dear Students,

As you know, this semester the course will be given virtually.
In addition to the mandatory weekly viewing assignments (see the Syllabus section
of the [Info page]({{ site.baseurl }}/info)), we will provide you with two weekly
Q&A sessions with the course staff.

1. Thursdays at 10:30.  
   Chaim will host a Q&A session regarding the lectures and
   general course material.

1. Thursdays at 11:30.  
   Aviv will host a Q&A session regarding the tutorial material and
   homework assignments.

Note that these meetings will only take place on dates where there is supposed
to be a class according to the [Technion calendar](https://www.admin.technion.ac.il/dpcalendar/).

Tomorrow, for the first lecture, Prof. Alex Bronstein will host the
meeting.

We wish you a productive semester.

Good luck,  
Course staff.
