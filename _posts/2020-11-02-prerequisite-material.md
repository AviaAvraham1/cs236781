Dear Students,

The mandatory viewing material for each week of this semester is as follows.

In each of the lecture links below, only the main video is mandatory. Anything
marked as "supplementary" is optional unless otherwise noted.

The in-class (zoom) lectures are now also **optional**. They will be 1h long
and only present more advanced topics and new research in the field.

- `22/10/2020`: Introduction ([ğŸ”—]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture_01/))
- `29/10/2020`: Supervised learning ([ğŸ”—]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture_02/))
- `05/11/2020`: 
  - Neural networks, CNNs ([ğŸ”—]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture_03/)).
  - Slides 29-40 from the first supplemental slide deck (linear models).
- `12/11/2020`: Training ([ğŸ”—]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture_04)) 
- `19/11/2020`: None
