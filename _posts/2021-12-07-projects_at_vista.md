Dear students,

The VISTA Lab is looking for excellent students (M.Sc. or final year
undergraduate) to conduct research projects on computational imaging. Our Deep
Learning course has strong applicability for these projects.

Please find below the project proposals with further details.
Interested students can contact [Tomer Weiss](mailto:tomerweiss196@gmail.com).
