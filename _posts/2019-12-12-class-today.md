There will be no tutorial.

Also please see the updated syllabus on the [info page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md %}).
Notice that next week there will be no class on Thursday 19/12, and instead there will be a class on **Sunday** 22/12 (this is a "Thursday Format" day in the Technion).
Then on the 26/12 there is again no class due to the holidays.

See you,<br>
