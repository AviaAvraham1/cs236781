Welcome to CS236781: Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators!

This semester, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the course will be given
virtually, over Zoom only.
First, please read the [info page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md %})
carefully and in full, as it contains crucial information about the course.

Note that this course requires use of the faculty compute cluster for access to
GPU-enabled servers. Please make sure you register for obtaining server access
using the link on the course site. Registration for the servers is required
**even if** you're officially enrolled in the course.

We hope you enjoy our course and have a productive semester!<br>
