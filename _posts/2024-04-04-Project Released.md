Dear Students,

Course final project had been released.
You can access it from relevant post on the assignments section.

Unlike previous homework assignments, for the project we will not work with Jupyter notebooks. 
Instead, we've provided you with a codebase you'd have to extend to do the designated assignment.
All needed information is in the mini-project.pdf file on the attached folder. **Please read it thoroughly before starting** and follow the instructions elaborated there. 

Due to exam period and this semester's special circumstances, we've given you a lot of time to work on the project.
Nonetheless, we strongly advise not to leave all of the work to the last minute. 
Bear in mind that, excluding reserve duty or other extreme circumstances, we will not be able to give further extensions.

For any questions regarding this assignment please use our Piazza channel as usual.

Best of luck,<br>
Course Staff.
