Dear Students,

We have opened a Piazza forum for your benefit.
This will serve as the **official** discussion forum for our course.

You can sign up and access Piazza
[here](https://piazza.com/technion.ac.il/spring2020/236781/home).

Please post all questions regarding course material and homework on the Piazza
forum and refrain from using email for this purpose.
This way all students can benefit collectively from the answers we post.

Notes about posting on Piazza:
- Select the proper **post type** (at the top of the "New Post" page).
  Select "Question" if you need an answer.
- Select the appropriate **folder** for your question, e.g. "hw1", "lectures",
  etc.


Thanks and enjoy,
Course staff.
