Dear Students,

We have opened a Piazza forum for your benefit.
This will serve as the **official** discussion forum for our course.

You can sign up and access Piazza [here](https://piazza.com/technion.ac.il/winter2021/236781).

Please post all non-personal questions regarding course material and homework
on the Piazza forum and refrain from using email for this purpose. This way all
students can benefit collectively from the answers we post.

Thanks and enjoy,<br>
Aviv & Course staff.
