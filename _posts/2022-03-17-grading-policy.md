excerpt: For homework assignments.

Dear Students,

The homework assignments in this course do not have equal weight.
Also, each assignment will be graded by a different HW checker.

The grading policy and HW checkers are as follows:


| #   | Weight | Graded By |
| -   | ------ | --------- |
| HW1 | 10%    | TBD       |
| HW2 | 20%    | TBD       |
| HW3 | 30%    | TBD       |
| HW4 | 40%    | TBD       |


Please note:
- Any appeals or inquiries about the grades should be sent directly to the
  relevant HW checker for the assignment, not to the TAs. 
- Technical questions about the HW assignments must be posted on Piazza only.


Good luck,  
Course staff.
