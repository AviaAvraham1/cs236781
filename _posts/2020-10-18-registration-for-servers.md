title: Registration for course servers
author: aviv
excerpt: Now open.

Dear students,

In order to use the course servers for the upcoming homework assignments,
we request that you register.
Note that enrollment in the course does **not automatically** provide server
access; if you wish you use the course servers, separate registration is
required.

**Deadline for registration is 05/11/2020**. After this date the list of
registered students who requested access will be passed to the CS faculty IT
team and granted access. Students who do not register on time forfeit access for
the entire semester.

Please register using [this link](https://forms.gle/tk3P2gRumfGJ8CNQ6).
Make sure to only provide your `@campus` email address.

Thanks,<br>
Course Staff
