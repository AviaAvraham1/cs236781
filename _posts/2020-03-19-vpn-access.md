Dear Students,

In order to use the course servers from outside the Technion, it's recommended
that you use the Technion VPN service.

Usually it's only possible to perform the initial setup from within the
Technion, but due to the COVID-19 situation it should now be possible to do it
from home as well. We recommend that you follow the
[instructions](https://cis.technion.ac.il/central-services/communication/off-campus-connection/otp/)
on the CIS site as soon as possible to setup a VPN connection.

Please note that we cannot provide you with technical support for this.  For
questions and issues regarding VPN setup and access, please contact the CIS
support team directly.


Thanks,  
Course staff.
