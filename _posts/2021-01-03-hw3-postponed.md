Dear students,

The due date for HW3 has been postponed to Thursday, January 21st.

The fourth assignment will include a mini-project which will contain both wet
and dry sections. The submission date for HW4 will be March 18th (the end of
the Moed-B period). Please plan accordingly. Further extension will be possible
in exceptional cases only (such as Miluim or adaptations for parents).

Good luck,<br>
Course staff
