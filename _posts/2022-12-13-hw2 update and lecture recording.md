Dear Students,

The second homework assignment files are updated.
The changes are:
1. "yourcnn" part is droped, you do not need to implement whatsoever.
2. The example name that got some of you confused is droped (no need to implement 256 dept...)
3. In part 6: you don't need to create a computational graph: some of you stated that they could not do it with the library of torchviz.
Effrat will publish a post in the piazza that show you it is possible and how it looks like,
 but we will not take points from the students who could not implement that.

Other than that, the lectures recording and the 7th tutorial was uploaded to the website as requested

 
 Good luck,
 Moshe Kimhi
