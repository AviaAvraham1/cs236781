Dear Students,

The Project is out and can be viewed in the [assignments]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/assignments.md %}) section.

The due data is far away, yet i recommand you to answer the dry part and look at this assignment before you work on it.

Top-down design can help you a lot! Try to break the task into smaller tasks that you can solve in one day.
Leave at least 5 days for training (after you know that training process is working), as you might need to tweak the hyper-parameters.

**Note**: this part has a hard deadline, means you can't get time extention
 
 Good luck,
 Moshe Kimhi
