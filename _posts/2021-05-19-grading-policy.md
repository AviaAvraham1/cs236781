excerpt: For homework assignments.

Dear Students,

The homework assignments in this course do not have equal weight.
The grading policy for the homework assignments is follows:
- HW1: 10%
- HW2: 20%
- HW3: 30%
- HW4 (mini project): 40%


We wish to remind you also:
- Appeals about the grades should be sent directly to the HW checkers, not
  TAs. We will publish the info of the relevant HW checker for each assignment.
- Technical questions must be posted on Piazza only.
- A bonus of 1, 2, or 3 points will be given to the three students with the
  highest number of instructor-endorsed answers on Piazza.


Good luck,  
Course staff.
