excerpt: For homework assignments.

Dear Students,

The homework assignments in this course do not have equal weight.
Also, each assignment will be graded by a different HW checker.

The grading policy and HW checkers are as follows:


| #                  | Weight | Graded By |
| -                  | ------ | --------- |
| HW1                | 10%    | Yaniv     |
| HW2                | 20%    | Evgenii   |
| HW3                | 30%    | Evgenii   |
| HW4 (mini-project) | 40%    | Ben       |


Please note:
- Any appeals or inquiries about the grades should be sent directly to the
  relevant HW checker for the assignment, not to the TAs. 
- Technical questions about the HW assignments must be posted on Piazza only.


Good luck,  
Course staff.
