excerpt: Required viewing material per week
---

Dear Students,

The **mandatory** viewing material for each week of this semester is detailed
in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md
%}#detailed-syllabus).

In each of the lecture links, only the main video is mandatory.
These lectures represent the core material of the course.
Anything marked as "supplementary" is optional unless otherwise noted.
The in-class lectures are also optional. They will be 1-hour long and aim to
present more advanced topics and new research in the field.

Thanks,  
Course staff.
