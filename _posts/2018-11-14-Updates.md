Dear students,

The submission date of HW1 has been postponed to November 24th.
The second homework assignment will be published soon thereafter.

The next tutorial (5) will be given by Aviv on the topic of Convolutional Neural
Networks (instead of RNNs) since this wasn't covered yet and it's relevant for
HW2.

See you,  
Course staff.
