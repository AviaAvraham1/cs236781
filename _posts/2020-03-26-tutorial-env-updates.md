Dear students,

Some of you have reported an issue with installing the `box2d` package on
Windows machines.  This package is used in tutorial 8 and HW4. 

An updated `environment.yml` file and instructions for Windows were published in
the tutorials repo. The Getting Started page was also updated.
Briefly, for Windows you should install Microsoft's [Build Tools for Visual
Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019)
and make sure "C++ Build Tools" is selected during installation.
Then, install the conda environment with the updated environment file
(preferably a clean install).

Note that even you don't manage to install this package on your system, you can
still view the tutorial 8 notebook on the site, and use the course server for
HW4.


Thanks to the students who reported the issue and solution.

Course Staff
