Hi everyone,

Please note my group's two upcoming tutorials, originally planned for 26/11 and 3/12, will not take place.Â 

Instead, we will hold a two-hour completion session (online, regular Zoom link) on Monday the 25/11, 16:30-18:30. We will cover CNNs and Optimization.

I will also publish recordings for those of you who cannot attend. You can also, of course, join Moshe's group those weeks.

See you then,

Tamir
