Dear students,

1. Please send all questions, comments and requests regarding homework
   assignments directly to me ([avivr@cs](mailto:avivr@cs.technion.ac.il)).
2. The rishon server will be down for maintenance on 7-8.1.2019. Please plan
   your work accordingly. Following this maintenance, 3 more GPUs (2080Ti) will
   be available on each compute node, which will allow more jobs to run
   concurrently.
3. Multiple students submitted manually created zip files containing only their
   code or code and result files. **This is not a valid submission**. All
   submissions must be generated by the `main.py` script that's provided with
   the assignment code. Please be
   sure to read the [submission instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _assignments/getting-started.md %})
   before submitting your next assignment.
4. A useful guide for windows users using mobaXterm was added to the [course
   servers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _assignments/hpc-servers.md %}) page.
   Thanks to Pavel Rastopchin.

Thanks,  
Course staff.
