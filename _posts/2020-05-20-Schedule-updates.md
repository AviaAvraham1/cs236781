Dear students,

1. Tomorrow's Zoom session with Chaim will be about auto encoders and
   unsupervised learning and the Zoom session with Aviv will be about attention
   mechanisms (notice this is tutorial 7, see syllabus).
1. This Sunday, May 24th, the Technion is on a Thursday-schedule so we will also
   have Zoom sessions. Chaim will continue with unsupervised learning and Aviv
   will talk about transfer learning (tutorial 6).
1. The last lecture of the course, on June 25th, will be given by Prof. Alex
   Bronstein, who will talk about Stein's phenomenon.

Thanks,<br>
Course staff
