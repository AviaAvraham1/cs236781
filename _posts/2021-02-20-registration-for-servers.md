title: Registration for course servers
author: aviv
excerpt: Now open.

Dear students,

This course requires use of a GPU for some of the homework assignments.
We can provide you access to the faculty's compute cluster which contains
GPU-enabled servers.

**Important**: enrollment in the course does **not automatically** provide
access to the course servers; if you wish you use the course servers, separate
registration is required using the link below.

**Deadline for registration is 15/04/2021**. After this date the list of
students who requested access (and are also officially enrolled to the course)
will be passed to the CS faculty IT team and granted access. Students who do
not register before the deadline forfeit server access for the entire semester!

Please register using [this link](https://forms.gle/hziK36Ba6PfbcQuTA).
Make sure to only provide your `@campus` email address.

Thanks,<br>
Course Staff
