Dear students,

Below are some guidelines regarding the homework assignments.

1. For any questions or clarifications regarding the content of the homework
   assignments, or other technical questions please email
   [Aviv](mailto:avivr@cs.technion.ac.il).
2. To request a delayed submission, please email
   [Chaim](mailto:chaimbaskin@cs.technion.ac.il) with a CC to
   [Evgenii](mailto:evgeniizh@campus.technion.ac.il), specifying a valid reason
   for the request.  Wait for approval of the request by email.
3. For inquiries or appeals about grades, please email
   [Evgenii](mailto:evgeniizh@campus.technion.ac.il).
4. Please note that even if your delay request is approved, any subsequent
   homework assignments may still be published on time and you may have to complete
   both assignments in parallel. Getting a delay for HW $n$ is not a
   valid reason for requesting a delay for HW ${n+1}$.
5. When submitting any assignment, delayed or otherwise, please make sure to only
   submit the zip file that was auto-generated from the `main.py` script, according to
   the instructions on the assignments page. Invalid submissions will not be
   checked.

Thanks,  
Course staff
