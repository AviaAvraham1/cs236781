Dear Students,

We would like to remind you that tomorrow (Wednesday 25/11) at 12:30 Aviv will
present tutorial 5. This is a new tutorial which is now available on the course
site. On Thursday (26/11), Aviv will present tutorial 6 at the usual hour (12:30).


In addition, Yaniv's tutorial (at 11:30) will not be given tomorrow.
Instead, Yaniv will teach both tutorials 5 and 6 next Wednesday (02/12) at 11:30-13:30.


Thanks,  
Course Staff
