Dear students,

New instructions about how to use the course servers are now available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _assignments/hpc-servers.md %}).

Please follow the instructions carefully and email me with any issues or suggestions.

As a reminder, please note that using the servers is not necessary for the first
assignment. You are however encouraged to try anyway.
