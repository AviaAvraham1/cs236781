Dear Students,

We have opened a Piazza forum for your benefit.
This will serve as the **only official** discussion forum for our course.

You can sign up and access Piazza
[here](https://piazza.com/technion.ac.il/winter2025/236781), by signing up with your
Technion `@campus` email. External (non-Technion) students can also access
Piazza by invitation. Such students should send me an email and request an invite
for the Piazza.

All questions regarding course material and homework **must** be posted on the
Piazza forum. Please refrain from using email for this purpose. This way all
students can benefit collectively from the answers we post.


Thanks and enjoy,<br>
Moshe & Course staff.
