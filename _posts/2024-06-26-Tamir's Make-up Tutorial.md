Dear Students,

Please note Tamir's tutorial tomorrow (27.6) will not be held due to student's day events.
Also, please note the tutorial on Thursday one week after (4.7) will not occur.

Instead, we will have two make-up tutorials this upcoming Monday (1.7) during the hours 1230-1430, in our regular room (Ullmann 306).
Note Monday's schedule in the Technion is actually a Thursday (נוהל יום ה).
 

See you on Then,
Tamir
