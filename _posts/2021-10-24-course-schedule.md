Dear Students,

Starting from Thursday, October 28th, 2021, the course weekly schedule is as follows:

1. Thursdays, 11:30-12:30, Taub 1.  
   Supplementary lecture, presented by Chaim Baskin or Prof. Alex Bronstein.

1. Thursdays at 12:30-13:30, Taub 1.  
   Tutorial, presented by Aviv Rosenberg.

1. Wednesdays at 11:30-12:30 Taub 9.
   Tutorial, presented by Yaniv Nemcovsky.

Notes:
- Yaniv's tutorial group starts from the **second** week of the semester, so
  that it comes after each week's lecture.
- The in-class lectures provide supplementary material; the main lecture
  material is covered by Alex's videos. Weekly video-viewing schedule is
  defined in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/info.md %}#detailed-syllabus).
  Make sure to watch the relevant video lecture each week **before** class.
- To support international students, all course materials, including lecture
  and tutorial videos, are provided in English.

We wish you a productive semester and hope you enjoy the course!


Good luck,  
Aviv & course staff.
